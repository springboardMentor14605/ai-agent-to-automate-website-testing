            "Response: **LangGraph** is a library developed by the LangChain team designed to build complex, stateful, and multi-actor applications using Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
            "\n",
            "While standard LangChain is great for creating linear \"chains\" of actions, LangGraph is built for creating **circular logic** (cycles), which is essential for building sophisticated AI agents.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Why do we need LangGraph?\n",
            "To understand LangGraph, you have to understand the limitation it solves:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Standard LangChain (DAGs):** Most chains are \"Directed Acyclic Graphs\" (DAGs). This means the flow moves in one direction: *Input -> Prompt -> LLM -> Output*.\n",
            "*   **The Problem:** Real-world agents often need to loop. They might try a task, fail, reflect on the error, and try again. Standard chains struggle to manage this \"looping\" state and complex decision-making logic.\n",
            "*   **The Solution:** LangGraph allows you to define a graph where nodes can loop back to each other, maintaining a persistent \"State\" throughout the process.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Core Concepts of LangGraph\n",
            "\n",
            "LangGraph operates on three main pillars:\n",
            "\n",
            "#### A. State\n",
            "The **State** is a shared data structure (like a Python dictionary or a Pydantic class) that represents the current \"memory\" of your graph. Every node in the graph reads the state, modifies it, and passes it on.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### B. Nodes\n",
            "**Nodes** are simply Python functions or LangChain \"Runnables.\" Each node performs a specific task, such as:\n",
            "*   Calling an LLM.\n",
            "*   Searching the web.\n",
            "*   Updating a database.\n",
            "*   Formatting a response.\n",
            "\n",
            "#### C. Edges\n",
            "**Edges** define the path between nodes. There are two types:\n",
            "*   **Normal Edges:** \"After Node A finishes, always go to Node B.\"\n",
            "*   **Conditional Edges:** \"After Node A finishes, look at the result. If the LLM says 'I'm done,' go to the End. If the LLM says 'I need more info,' go to the Search Node.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Key Features\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Cycles (Loops):** The ability to create iterative processes. For example: *Research -> Critique -> Revise -> Critique again.*\n",
            "2.  **Persistence (Checkpoints):** LangGraph can automatically save the state of the graph after every step. This allows for \"error recovery\" (if the app crashes, it resumes where it left off) and \"human-in-the-loop\" interactions.\n",
            "3.  **Human-in-the-loop:** You can program the graph to **pause** and wait for a human to approve an action (like a tool call or a budget spend) before continuing.\n",
            "4.  **Fine-grained Control:** Unlike the older LangChain \"Agents\" (which were often \"black boxes\"), LangGraph forces you to define the flow explicitly, making it much easier to debug and customize.\n",
            "\n",
            "---\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. A Simple Workflow Example: A Research Agent\n",
            "\n",
            "Imagine an agent that writes a blog post:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Node 1 (Planner):** Generates an outline.\n",
            "2.  **Node 2 (Researcher):** Searches the web for facts.\n",
            "3.  **Node 3 (Writer):** Writes the draft.\n",
            "4.  **Conditional Edge (Reviewer):** Checks the draft.\n",
            "    *   *If the draft is poor:* Loop back to **Node 2** to get better facts.\n",
            "    *   *If the draft is good:* Go to **End**.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "### 5. When should you use it?\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Use LangChain** if you have a simple, linear pipeline (e.g., a basic RAG application that retrieves a document and answers a question).\n",
            "*   **Use LangGraph** if you are building:\n",
            "    *   **Agents** that need to use tools and reason about the results.\n",
            "    *   **Multi-agent systems** (where one LLM talks to another).\n",
            "    *   **Long-running processes** that require human intervention or state persistence.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Summary\n",
