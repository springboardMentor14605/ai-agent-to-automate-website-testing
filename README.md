# AI-agent-to-automate-website-testing
This project implements an intelligent agent capable of performing automated end-to-end
(E2E) testing on web applications. The agent accepts natural language instructions,
interprets them, generates Playwright test scripts, executes those scripts in a headless
browser, and produces detailed test reports.
